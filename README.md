# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

My name is Jared, and I am currently learning Java! It is super exciting, yet challenging. I am going to share code I write here on GitHub for anyone to see. I am hoping by sharing my code I can learn from this wonderful community, and maybe even help someone out!
